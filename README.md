# Pangram Beer

Dumb shit project (a.k.a. [Sara Vieira](https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW)) for my currently favorite activity at spare time: Thinking of [Pangrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram) names for my Homemade Beers.

Built in Vue.js PWA, built in 1 hour and 30min (ish). It was pretty cool :)
Still has some bugs to fix, and features to implement, but I need to get back to work.
